Roberts Mountains Allochthon Presentation at GSA Spokane 2024
This is a pdf file that reduces file size from the original Powerpoint format. Notes below the figures describe each slide. I have to use Portrait Orientation to display the notes.
You can adjust the pdf page width to 150% to view figures and notes without all the blank space at the bottom of the page.
